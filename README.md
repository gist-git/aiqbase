# Real World Problems in AI and Data Science
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Question Sets and related Data for Real World Industry Experience.

The repository is maintained by [Global Indian Scientists and Technocrats forum](https://gistusa.org/) and is designed to prepare 3rd and 4th year engineering students for industry jobs in data science and artificial intelligence. Each sub-repository comes with a set of problems and a link to the relevant data sets that are necessary to solve these problems. In general the problems are in the order from trivial to unsolvable. 

Hope this is useful to you. If you successfully solve a problem, please create a pull request. Don't forget to include your contact information. 

If you want to help scale this initiative, you can:
1. Share within your institute, circle of friends and others who you think can use this resource. 
2. Write model solutions to each of the problems in Python, R, Java or other languages. 
3. Suggest or write programs that can automatically evaluate the proposed solutions along accuracy, latency, scalability and other factors. 
4. Contribute new problem sets. Each set should have 8-12 problems starting from trivial to unsolvable, and should have all the data that is necessary to solve the problems. The data should be freely accessile (i.e. not behind a paywall, etc.). 
5. Come join us our team so that we can take this initiative to each and every college. 

Happy Programing!
