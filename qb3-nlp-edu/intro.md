Coronavirus has brought the model of online teaching to mainstream. This is also an opportunity for AI to become a genuine educational aid and make learning fun and engaging for students. 

This set of questions references [National Digital Library of India](https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/homestudy/engineering) and an example [Learning Model](https://arden.ac.uk/what-type-learner-are-you) 

We suggest you focus on one subject area for these problems. 

1. Write a program to identify each student and access their academic records like subjects, marks, choices, etc.
2. Write a program to classify each student as one of seven types of learners. Use [standard tests](https://arden.ac.uk/what-type-learner-are-you) to create the training data for your model. 
3. Use open sources APIs and software to write a program to ingest text-based digital repositories on various subjects and classify them as being suitable for one of the seven learning types.  
4. Use open sources APIs and software to write a program to ingest image-based content in digital repositories on various subjects, OCR the text contained in them and classify them as being suitable for one of the seven learning types. 
5. Use open sources APIs and software to write a program to ingest video-based content in digital repositories on various subjects, transcribe their content in them and classify them as being suitable for one of the seven learning types. 
6. Write a program to highlight respective topical content based on a student's question and learning style. 
7. Write a program to automatically generate test questions and their answers from the repositories. You may want to complete the question set about [Machine Reading Comprehension](https://github.com/gist-git/aiqbase/tree/main/qb1-nlp-mrc) first. 
8. Write a program to test students on their knowledge of subject and suggest remedial content based on their answers and learning styles. 
9. Write a program to make the tests referred to in Problem 8 dynamically adaptive i.e. the level of questions should change based on student's answers. 
10. Create a chatbot like interface to be a student's learning companion that can help a) answer questions; b) test their knowledge of a topic; c) create study materials for a topic; d) deliver the study material in easy, question answer format.
