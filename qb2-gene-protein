1. Write a program to calculate the GC% (vs AT) of the DNA Sequence.
2. Write a program to identity the 5'UTR (Untranslated region) of the gene. Is there a sub-linear program possible? 
3. Write a program to identify the start and stop codons.  Is there a sub-linear program possible? 
4. Write a program to identify the 3â€™UTR of the gene.  Is there a sub-linear program possible? 
5. Write a program to identify the number of introns and exons in the gene.
6. Write a program to transcribe the gene.
7. Write a program to translate the transcript.
8. Write a program to identify miRNA binding sites. Is there a sub-linear program possible? Is it possible to identify unknown indicators? 
9. Write a program to identify transcription factor binding sites. Is there a sub-linear program possible? Is it possible to identify unknown indicators? 
10. Write a program to identify the protein secondary structure.
